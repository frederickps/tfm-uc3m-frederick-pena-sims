## Caveates

Two files containing data are too large to upload them to GitHub. Follow the instructions to download them. Store the files in the folder 'Data_2020'

<u>Budget and revenue data (CONPREL)</u>

To download the correct file choose the option "Liquidaciones" from the year "2020". Download the file available below "2 - Datos por Entidad Local. MÃ¡ximo nivel de desglose (Formato ACCESS)" (see picture below).

<u>Age data per municipality</u>

Go to https://www.ine.es/jaxiT3/Tabla.htm?t=33575&L=0 and download the entire file. Store the file under 'avg_age_2020'. This step is not strictly necessary. A cleaned up version is stored in 'Data_2020' as 'avg_age_final'.
